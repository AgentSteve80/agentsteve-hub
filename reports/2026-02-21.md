## 🚨 CRITICAL — Security

### 1. ⚠️ CVE-2026-25253 — OpenClaw RCE (CVSS 8.8) — YOU ARE PATCHED, UPDATE ANYWAY
**Relevance: 10/10** `#security` `#openclaw` `#rce` `#immediate`
**Links:** [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25253) · [Conscia Advisory](https://conscia.com/blog/the-openclaw-security-crisis/) · [OpenClaw Releases](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases)

A critical one-click RCE chain in OpenClaw's WebSocket connection handling (no origin validation) was patched in **v2026.1.29**. Your installed version is **2026.2.17** — you are past the CVE patch. But you are two releases behind the latest **v2026.2.19**, which adds:

- `Security/Audit`: new `gateway.http.no_auth` finding that warns (loopback) or alerts critical (remote) when `auth.mode="none"` is configured and HTTP APIs are reachable
- `Skills`: hardened coding-agent skill guidance — removed shell-command examples that interpolate untrusted issue text directly into commands (prompt injection hardening)

Additional context from the Conscia advisory — structural issues that still apply to all versions:
- **Credentials in plaintext files** — API keys stored unencrypted on disk (Claude key, Convex key, etc.)
- **ClawHub supply chain**: 341–1,184+ malicious skills discovered in the marketplace, including skills that steal SSH keys, exfiltrate API tokens, and deliver Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS) on Mac. ~20% of registry is now flagged malicious.
- **30,000+ internet-exposed instances** identified by Censys/Bitsight — yours is on a hardened Ubuntu VM behind NAT, so likely not publicly exposed, but worth confirming.

**So what / actions right now:**
1. `openclaw gateway update` — update to v2026.2.19 immediately for the no_auth audit tool and skill hardening
2. Check exposed ports: `ss -tlnp | grep 18789` — if the Control UI port is exposed to anything other than 127.0.0.1, lock it down
3. Audit installed skills: `openclaw skills list` — review each one, especially any you don't recognize. Remove anything from ClawHub that you didn't explicitly install recently
4. Secrets: your API keys in `~/.openclaw/secrets/convex.env` are plaintext — consider mounting this as a tmpfs or at minimum ensuring `chmod 600` and the file is excluded from any backups that leave the machine
5. **Do not install new ClawHub skills** until the marketplace security situation stabilizes

### 2. 🔒 The Watchers — OpenAI, Persona, US Government Built a Surveillance Pipeline
**Relevance: 9/10** `#security` `#privacy` `#identity`
**Links:** [vmfunc.re](https://vmfunc.re/blog/persona/) · [Reddit/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1r8btwt/) · [HN](https://lobste.rs/domains/vmfunc.re)

Security researchers published a detailed expose of an undisclosed data pipeline between **Persona** (the identity verification service used by OpenAI, LinkedIn, Discord, Roblox, and hundreds of others) and US federal agencies including ICE. When you verify your identity on any of these platforms, Persona collects your government ID images, selfie biometrics, SSN fragments, and behavioral data — and some of this flows to federal databases through automated risk-scoring and compliance reporting that Persona has never publicly disclosed.

This is the second major story this week connecting identity verification services to government surveillance (following the LinkedIn story at #3).

**So what:** Two concrete actions. (1) **For you personally**: If you've done identity verification on OpenAI, LinkedIn, or Discord, request your Persona data deletion at `idv-privacy@withpersona.com`. (2) **For Pal's apps**: Before you add any third-party identity verification to Pal Field App or Pal Web — for tech onboarding, background checks, etc. — understand that services like Persona/Stripe Identity/Jumio all participate in similar data pipelines. Clerk (what you currently use) does not do government ID verification, which is the right call.

### 3. 🔒 "I Verified My LinkedIn Identity. Here's What I Actually Handed Over."
**Relevance: 7/10** `#security` `#privacy` `#identity`
**Links:** [thelocalstack.eu](https://thelocalstack.eu/posts/linkedin-identity-verification-privacy/) · [HN #2, 268 pts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47098245)

A researcher actually completed LinkedIn's identity verification (powered by Persona), then methodically documented what was collected: government ID front/back, selfie biometrics, liveness detection video, device fingerprint, IP, browser metadata. LinkedIn claims data is deleted within 14 days; researcher found Persona's own data retention terms contradict this. Story gained traction after being shared by Brian Krebs.

**So what:** Don't verify your LinkedIn identity. Also reinforces #2 above — Persona is the common thread between LinkedIn, OpenAI, and dozens of other platforms.

## 🤖 AI / Agents

### 4. 🔥 Karpathy Coins "Claws" — OpenClaw Named as the Reference Implementation
**Relevance: 10/10** `#ai` `#agent` `#openclaw` `#category`
**Links:** [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/21/claws/) · [Karpathy tweet](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/2024987174077432126) · [HN #5, 141 pts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47099160)

Andrej Karpathy (ex-Tesla AI, ex-OpenAI, coined "vibe coding") posted a mini-essay about buying a Mac Mini to tinker with "Claws" — his term for the entire category of OpenClaw-like personal AI agent systems. Key quote:

> *"I do love the concept and I think that just like LLM agents were a new layer on top of LLMs, Claws are now a new layer on top of LLM agents, taking the orchestration, scheduling, context, tool calls and a kind of persistence to a next level."*

He specifically mentioned OpenClaw by name but expressed reservations about running it (likely the CVE situation noted above). He highlighted **NanoClaw** as interesting for its small, auditable codebase (~500 lines, runs everything in containers). He also noted the emerging ecosystem: NanoClaw, zeroclaw, ironclaw, picoclaw.

Simon Willison's take: *"'Claw' is becoming a term of art for the entire category... AI agents that generally run on personal hardware, communicate via messaging protocols and can both act on direct instructions and schedule tasks. It even comes with an established emoji 🦞."*

**So what:** This is a category-defining moment. You're running OpenClaw — the reference implementation of a new computing paradigm that Karpathy just christened. The concerns he raises (auditability, security) are valid and map exactly to the CVE situation above. NanoClaw is worth watching as a lightweight, security-focused alternative — but you don't need to switch, you need to harden what you have (see #1). The "Claw" category is now legitimate enough that Karpathy is publicly experimenting with it, which means mainstream developer interest is incoming. OpenClaw's security posture will define whether it becomes the go-to or gets displaced by smaller, more auditable competitors.

### 5. NanoClaw — Lightweight Claw Competitor, ~500 Lines, Containers by Default
**Relevance: 7/10** `#ai` `#agent` `#openclaw` `#security`
**Links:** [Reddit r/ClaudeCode](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1r3qlht/nanoclaw_runs_on_claude_agent_sdk_each_agent_in/) · [NanoClaw demo](https://lilys.ai/en/notes/openai-agent-builder-20260208/nanoclaw-lightweight-secure-ai-assistant)

NanoClaw is a minimal personal AI agent that Karpathy specifically called out. Built on Claude Agent SDK, ~500 lines of code, each agent runs in an isolated Docker container. Connects to WhatsApp, reads email, sets recurring tasks. The entire codebase fits in context.

**So what:** The "fits in context" argument is compelling — you can audit the entire agent in one pass, and so can an LLM. NanoClaw isn't a replacement for OpenClaw today (OpenClaw has vastly more features, skills, tooling), but its design philosophy should influence how you think about OpenClaw hardening. Specifically: the container-per-agent model means a compromised skill can't touch the host system or other agents. OpenClaw doesn't have this isolation by default. Worth watching as a reference for the right architecture.

## 🛠️ Dev Tooling

### 6. `jtolio/ajail` — Bubblewrap Wrapper for Sandboxing Untrusted Code (Lobsters)
**Relevance: 7/10** `#security` `#infrastructure` `#docker` `#openclaw`
**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/jtolio/ajail) · [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/s/rcewff/ajail_basic_jail_for_programs_you_don_t)

`ajail` is a thin wrapper around `bubblewrap` (the same sandbox used by Flatpak) that makes it trivial to jail any program: no network, no filesystem access, no capabilities by default. Single Go binary. Designed for exactly the scenario of "I want to run this agent-generated code but I don't fully trust it."

```bash
ajail -- python3 untrusted_script.py
```

**So what:** Directly relevant to OpenClaw and to Pal Field App's backend. Any time an OpenClaw sub-agent runs a shell command or executes code, that execution should happen inside a jail like this. It's also useful for local development — run `npm install` from a dependency you're evaluating inside ajail to prevent supply-chain attacks from running arbitrary code on your machine. Works on Linux (your Ubuntu VM) out of the box.

### 7. `sstephenson/brat` — Parallel POSIX Shell TAP Test Harness (Lobsters)
**Relevance: 5/10** `#testing` `#tools`
**Links:** [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/sstephenson/brat) · [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/s/wul2hi/brat_parallel_tap_testing_harness_for)

`brat` is a minimal parallel TAP test runner for POSIX shell scripts, written by Sam Stephenson (creator of rbenv, Sprockets). Shell scripts run in parallel by default, output is clean TAP format, zero dependencies.

**So what:** Relevant for scripting infrastructure tests — Convex deploy checks, Docker health checks, API smoke tests that are easier to write as shell scripts than as Jest tests. If you ever need to test your deploy pipeline (`convex dev --once`, git hooks, etc.), brat is the right tool. Low priority now but worth bookmarking.
