## 🚨 CRITICAL — Security

### 1. 🔥 AI-Assisted Attacker Breached 600+ FortiGate Firewalls in 5 Weeks — Amazon Confirms
**Relevance: 10/10** `#security` `#ai` `#threat-intel` `#immediate`
**Links:** [AWS Security Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/ai-augmented-threat-actor-accesses-fortigate-devices-at-scale/) · [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/amazon-ai-assisted-hacker-breached-600-fortigate-firewalls-in-5-weeks/) · [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-20/hackers-used-ai-to-breach-600-firewalls-in-weeks-amazon-says) · [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/ai-assisted-threat-actor-compromises.html)

Amazon Threat Intelligence published a detailed report on a Russian-speaking, financially motivated threat actor who used **multiple commercial generative AI services** to compromise **600+ FortiGate firewall devices across 55 countries from January 11 to February 18, 2026** — a 5-week campaign. The attack vector wasn't some exotic zero-day: the actor used AI to rapidly enumerate devices with **weak credentials and single-factor authentication**, then automated exploitation at a scale previously requiring a team.

The AWS write-up is the primary source — it's a rare first-person threat intel disclosure directly naming the technique: using gen-AI tooling to accelerate recon, credential stuffing, and post-exploitation scripting.

**So what:** This is the first well-documented, publicly confirmed case of commercial AI tools being used as a force multiplier in a large-scale network intrusion campaign — not theoretical. Three concrete actions: **(1)** If you have any FortiGate or similar perimeter devices anywhere, rotate credentials and enable MFA immediately. **(2)** For Pal Field App and Pal Web: your Convex + Clerk stack doesn't expose traditional network perimeter devices, but this pattern (AI + weak credentials at scale) is coming for SaaS APIs next. Make sure all admin accounts use strong unique passwords + MFA. **(3)** Single-factor auth anywhere in your stack is now a meaningful risk, not just a best-practice checkbox.

### 2. 🔴 Dell RecoverPoint CVE-2026-22769 — Hardcoded Credentials, Exploited in Espionage Campaign, CISA 3-Day Patch Mandate
**Relevance: 8/10** `#security` `#cve` `#infra`
**Links:** [SOC Prime](https://socprime.com/blog/cve-2026-22769-vulnerability/) · [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/cisa_dell_vulnerability/)

A critical hardcoded-credential vulnerability in **Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines** was publicly disclosed and is already being actively exploited in an espionage campaign. CISA gave federal agencies a **3-day patch mandate** — the shortest window they issue, reserved for vulns being weaponized right now. Unauthenticated remote access to the underlying OS via known credentials.

**So what:** Not directly relevant to your stack, but the pattern matters — hardcoded/default credentials in infrastructure products continue to be exploited faster than they're patched. The CISA 3-day window signals confirmed nation-state use. Low direct risk unless your team ever manages enterprise backup appliances.

### 3. 🔴 Chrome Zero-Day CVE-2026-2441 — Actively Exploited, Patched This Week
**Relevance: 7/10** `#security` `#cve` `#browser`
**Links:** [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/new-chrome-zero-day-cve-2026-2441-under.html) · [SecPod](https://www.secpod.com/blog/google-addresses-actively-exploited-chrome-vulnerability-cve-2026-2441/)

The first actively-exploited Chrome zero-day of 2026 was patched this week. Could allow remote code execution inside Chrome's sandbox. Google pushed the fix — update Chrome if you haven't.

**So what:** Just update Chrome. Auto-update is on by default. Check `chrome://settings/help` to confirm you're on the latest build.

### 4. 🔐 BeyondTrust RCE CVE-2026-1731 — CVSS 9.9, Remote Support Tool
**Relevance: 6/10** `#security` `#cve` `#rce`
**Links:** [Orca Security](https://orca.security/resources/blog/cve-2026-1731-beyondtrust-vulnerability/)

CVSS 9.9 RCE in BeyondTrust Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access, disclosed February 6. If your company uses BeyondTrust for remote IT support tooling, it's critical. Low direct relevance to your stack but notable because CVSS 9.9 is essentially as bad as it gets.

### 5. 🔥 Anthropic Launches Claude Code Security — Automated Codebase Vulnerability Scanning
**Relevance: 10/10** `#ai` `#security` `#claudecode` `#tools`
**Links:** [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/anthropic-launches-claude-code-security.html) · [CyberSecurity News](https://cybersecuritynews.com/claude-code-security/) · [CyberScoop](https://cyberscoop.com/anthropic-claude-code-security-automated-security-review/)

Anthropic launched **Claude Code Security** — a new feature that scans your entire codebase for vulnerabilities, runs a multi-layered self-verification pass to reduce false positives, assigns severity and confidence ratings to each finding, and suggests concrete patches. Available to engineering and security teams. Works on full repos, not just snippets.

**So what:** This is directly relevant and free to try right now. Three codebases to run it on: **Mission Control**, **Pal Web**, and **Pal Field App**. The security scan would be especially useful before Pal goes live with real users (the open items around Clerk, Convex auth, and the API key handling). This is now the most practical way to do a pre-launch security audit without hiring a pen tester.

### 6. 🔥 GitHub Agentic Workflows — AI Agents Inside GitHub Actions (Technical Preview)
**Relevance: 9/10** `#ai` `#automation` `#github` `#devtools`
**Links:** [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/17/github_previews_agentic_workflows/) · [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/news/2026/02/github-agentic-workflows/) · [winbuzzer](https://winbuzzer.com/2026/02/17/github-agentic-workflows-technical-preview-continuous-ai-xcxwbn/)

GitHub launched **Agentic Workflows** in technical preview — runs AI coding agents (GitHub Copilot, **Claude Code**, or OpenAI Codex) directly inside GitHub Actions, triggered by repo events. The agent receives a prompt like "triage new issues, apply labels, and comment with a suggested fix" and executes it autonomously with full repo context. Use cases GitHub calls out: issue triage, documentation updates, CI failure investigation, test coverage analysis, and automated health reports.

**So what:** This is the most immediately useful AI automation announcement for your workflow. Mission Control, Pal Web, and Pal Field App all have GitHub repos. You could set up an Agentic Workflow to: **(1)** auto-triage new issues and apply labels, **(2)** investigate failing CI runs and comment root-cause analysis, **(3)** weekly repo health reports posted to a PR. The fact that Claude Code is a supported agent means your existing code context works. This is in technical preview — sign up at `github.com/features/agentic-workflows`.

### 7. 🔑 Xcode 26.3 — Apple Opens Full IDE to Coding Agents (Claude Code + Codex)
**Relevance: 8/10** `#ai` `#mobile` `#xcode` `#expo`
**Links:** [Apple Newsroom](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/02/xcode-26-point-3-unlocks-the-power-of-agentic-coding/)

Apple released Xcode 26.3, opening up deep IDE access to external coding agents. Claude Code and Codex can now "collaborate throughout the entire development lifecycle" inside Xcode — not just code generation but understanding build errors, navigating the project structure, running simulators, and reading crash logs. This is a significant change from Xcode historically being a closed, Apple-only AI ecosystem.

**So what:** Directly relevant to Pal Field App. Once you move to EAS Build and eventually distribute to the App Store, having Claude Code with native Xcode integration could dramatically speed up the iOS-specific debugging (simulator issues, signing profiles, entitlements). When you're ready to do that EAS build, worth having Xcode 26.3 on your Mac.

### 8. Figma "Code to Canvas" — Convert AI-Generated Code Back into Editable Designs
**Relevance: 7/10** `#ai` `#design` `#figma`
**Links:** [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/figma-anthropic-ai-code-designs.html)

Figma partnered with Anthropic to launch **Code to Canvas** — paste in code generated by Claude Code (or any AI tool) and it converts the code into a fully editable Figma design. The reverse of the normal Figma→code workflow. Useful when you've built a UI in code and want to hand it off to a designer or create a design system component from it.

**So what:** When Pal Web moves to Phase 2 (job creation forms, invoice UI, tech invite flow), this could speed up the design/dev loop — build it in code with Claude, import into Figma for design review, hand back to dev. Niche but potentially very useful for a one-person dev team doing both design and code.

### 9. React Dev Survey: TanStack Gaining Ground as Frustration with Next.js Grows
**Relevance: 8/10** `#dev` `#nextjs` `#react` `#mission-control`
**Links:** [DevClass](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)

A new community React survey shows **TanStack Start** gaining significant mindshare as developers express frustration with Next.js — specifically around server components complexity, deployment lock-in to Vercel, and debugging difficulty in server/client hybrid rendering. React itself is described as "the default UI for AI-generated apps" and isn't going anywhere, but the meta-framework layer is becoming contested.

**So what:** Mission Control is Next.js. This isn't a "you should migrate" signal, but it is context for future architectural decisions. The Vercel deployment lock-in concern is real — you've already seen it (no GitHub integration, must deploy via CLI). If Mission Control's Vercel bill ever becomes a pain point, TanStack Start + a plain server would be the natural exit. Worth keeping an eye on TanStack Start's stability over the next few months.

### 10. Cloudflare Moltworker — Self-Hosted AI Agent Running on Workers + Playwright
**Relevance: 7/10** `#ai` `#automation` `#selfhosted` `#cloudflare`
**Links:** [Cloudflare Blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/moltworker-self-hosted-ai-agent/)

Cloudflare published a deep-dive on **Moltworker**, a self-hosted AI agent that runs on Cloudflare Workers using their Sandbox SDK. Notable because it runs **Playwright** (full browser automation) natively inside Workers — a thing that was previously impossible. Can browse, extract, interact with web UIs, run recurring tasks. No server required, runs entirely on Cloudflare's edge.

**So what:** Interesting architecture for automating the kind of web research you currently do via cron jobs. If you ever want Mission Control's research cycle to do browser-based research (scraping pages that block API access, navigating SPA-based sites), a Moltworker-style setup on Cloudflare Workers could handle it. Not urgent, but worth bookmarking for when the research cycle needs to go beyond search APIs.

### 11. n8n Reaches 175,000 Stars — The Leading Self-Hosted Zapier Alternative
**Relevance: 7/10** `#automation` `#selfhosted` `#nocode`
**Links:** [XDA Developers](https://www.xda-developers.com/this-self-hosted-automation-tool-does-what-zapier-charges-20month-for/) · [GitHub](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n)

n8n hit 175,000 GitHub stars, cementing its position as the dominant self-hosted workflow automation platform. The XDA piece is a practical guide to replacing Zapier's most common use cases (email triggers, Slack notifications, form data routing, API webhooks) at zero cost on your own server.

**So what:** As Pal grows beyond the MVP, you'll eventually need automation glue — tech submits a form → Slack notification → invoice created. n8n handles all of that without SaaS fees. Given your Ubuntu VM setup, a Docker-based n8n instance would be straightforward. Worth considering before you reach for Zapier or Make when Pal Field App needs automation workflows.

## 📱 Mobile / Expo

### 12. React Native New Architecture: No Performance Difference vs Old in 2026 — Survey Confirms
**Relevance: 6/10** `#mobile` `#react-native` `#expo` `#pal-field-app`
**Links:** [Markaicode](https://markaicode.com/react-native-vs-expo-2026-cursor/)

A developer survey confirms there's **no measurable performance difference** between the Old and New Architecture in 2026 in production apps. Both have reached equivalent stability. The Pal Field App migration to New Arch (`newArchEnabled: true`) is confirmed as the right call for SDK 54 and beyond — no performance regression risk.

**So what:** Validates the arch decision already made in Pal Field App. New Architecture is stable. The only remaining concern is the Expo dev server live device test once Andrew scans the QR code.
