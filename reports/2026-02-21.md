## 🤖 AI

### 1. 🔥 `ggml-org/llama.cpp` — ggml.ai Joins Hugging Face to Keep Local AI Open
**Relevance: 9/10** `#ai` `#llm` `#local-inference` `#infrastructure`
**Links:** [HF Blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/ggml-joins-hf) · [llama.cpp Discussion](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/19759) · [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/20/ggmlai-joins-hugging-face/) · **682 pts on HN**

Georgi Gerganov (creator of llama.cpp and ggml) announced that ggml.ai is joining Hugging Face. Both projects remain fully open source and community-autonomous — this is about resources and longevity, not acquisition. HF will fund and support development while ggml maintains independence. Goal: make llama.cpp "ubiquitous and readily available everywhere," dramatically improve packaging and UX for casual users, and accelerate local inference as a competitive alternative to cloud APIs.

**So what:** This is the most significant local AI infrastructure news in months. llama.cpp is already the backbone of local model inference across every platform — this move guarantees its long-term funding and prevents ggml from being acquired by a closed-source player. For you: (1) The planned UX improvements mean local inference via llama.cpp becomes viable for non-technical users faster than expected — relevant if Pal Field App ever needs on-device AI (job closeout suggestions, note transcription). (2) OpenClaw's agent tasks that currently hit Claude API could shift to local llama.cpp models for privacy-sensitive operations once packaging improves. Watch this closely — HF's distribution network + ggml's engine is a powerful combination.

### 2. 🆕 Cord — Coordinating Trees of AI Agents (HN)
**Relevance: 8/10** `#ai` `#agent` `#openclaw` `#architecture`
**Links:** [june.kim/cord](https://www.june.kim/cord) · [HN Thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47096466)

Well-written technical essay arguing that every existing multi-agent framework (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, Swarm, Anthropic's tool-use loops) requires the developer to predefine the coordination structure. Cord proposes letting agents themselves decide how to decompose work into trees of subtasks with typed results, explicit dependency tracking, and scoped authority. Agents spawn subtasks, wait for dependencies, and return structured results — no static workflow graph required.

The key insight: "Every framework requires the developer to predefine the coordination structure. You decide the workflow graph, the agent roles, the handoff pattern. The agents execute within your boundaries. This made sense when agents were unreliable. But current models are good at planning."

**So what:** This directly maps to how `sessions_spawn` works in OpenClaw today — you manually define which sub-agent does what. Cord's model (agents self-decompose into a tree, with typed results flowing up) is a significant upgrade. Two things to steal immediately: (1) **typed results** — when a sub-agent completes, it should return a structured JSON result, not just narrative text, so the orchestrator can make decisions; (2) **dependency tracking** — if task B depends on task A's output, encode that explicitly rather than relying on prompt ordering. Neither requires a new framework, just better conventions in your OpenClaw cron jobs and subagent patterns.

### 3. `obra/superpowers` — Agentic Skills Framework (Still Trending Day 2)
**Relevance: 8/10** `#ai` `#agent` `#openclaw` `#skills`
**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) · [Claude Plugin Marketplace](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official)

Still on GitHub Trending for a second day — notable staying power. The full workflow: spec extraction via conversation → structured design doc you approve in sections → implementation plan → TDD-driven subagents that execute and self-review. Auto-triggers without prompting once installed. Now in the official Anthropic plugin marketplace. The methodology is the product.

**So what:** If you haven't installed Superpowers yet — do it now. The spec-first, review-before-coding workflow directly addresses the "agent dives in without understanding the problem" failure mode. Use it for the next Mission Control feature or Pal Web Phase 2 kick-off. The brainstorming and planning skills alone will save hours of rework.

### 4. `huggingface/skills` — HF Launches Standardized Skills for AI Coding Tools
**Relevance: 8/10** `#ai` `#agent` `#openclaw` `#skills`
**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/skills) · [Show HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47092061)

Hugging Face launched a `skills` repo — Markdown files that inject domain knowledge into AI coding tools. When a developer starts building an API, the tool automatically loads the relevant standard or domain context. No plugins to write, no code. A marketplace of these skills is already live. The format is deliberately minimal: structured Markdown with trigger conditions and context blocks.

**So what:** This is converging with what Anthropic is doing with `claude-plugins-official` and what OpenClaw already does with `SKILL.md` files — and now HF is validating the pattern from a third direction. The ecosystem is standardizing around "Markdown files that trigger contextual agent behavior." OpenClaw's skill system is ahead of the curve here. Practical action: look at HF's skill format and see if OpenClaw Skills can be made cross-compatible with minimal changes. If they can, OpenClaw Skills could be published to HF's marketplace.

### 5. `ComposioHQ/composio` — 1,000+ Pre-Built Agent Tool Integrations (GitHub Trending)
**Relevance: 7/10** `#ai` `#agent` `#automation` `#openclaw`
**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio) · [composio.dev](https://composio.dev)

Composio provides 1,000+ pre-built tool integrations for AI agents (Gmail, GitHub, Slack, Linear, etc.) with managed OAuth, context management, and a sandboxed workbench. TypeScript SDK: `npm install @composio/core`. Compatible with Claude, OpenAI Agents, LangGraph. The managed auth layer is the real differentiator — agents can act in connected services without you building OAuth flows.

**So what:** Relevant once OpenClaw needs to interact with external services programmatically (Gmail for job import, Slack for team notifications, etc.). The Gmail toolkit specifically maps directly to the Pal Field App job import flow we deferred. Worth bookmarking rather than implementing now — but when the Gmail OAuth project starts, Composio's pre-built connector will save significant plumbing time.

## 🔐 Security

### 6. ⚠️ "I Found a Vulnerability. They Found a Lawyer." — HN #4 Today
**Relevance: 8/10** `#security` `#legal`
**Links:** [dixken.de](https://dixken.de/blog/i-found-a-vulnerability-they-found-a-lawyer) · [HN 396 pts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47092578) · **182 comments**

A researcher disclosed a vulnerability through proper channels, only to receive a legal threat from the company's lawyers rather than a bug bounty or acknowledgment. Detailed account of the chilling effect on security research, VDP (Vulnerability Disclosure Programs) failures, and what happens when companies weaponize lawyers against researchers who acted in good faith.

**So what:** Two angles. (1) **For Pal's apps**: Don't be this company. If you ever receive a good-faith security report on Mission Control, Pal Web, or Pal Field App, respond professionally. Publish a VDP contact (security@pallowvoltage.com or equivalent) before you have users. (2) **For your own research**: Know your legal exposure before disclosing. The researcher in this case made errors in how they communicated — worth reading to understand the exact tripwires. The HN comments have solid practical guidance on safe harbor language and responsible disclosure protocol.

### 7. "Turn Dependabot Off" — HN #2, 322 pts
**Relevance: 7/10** `#security` `#devops` `#automation`
**Links:** [filippo.io](https://words.filippo.io/dependabot/) · [HN 322 pts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47094192) · **84 comments**

Filippo Valsorda (Go cryptography maintainer, ex-Google/Cloudflare) makes a compelling case for disabling Dependabot and replacing it with two GitHub Actions: one running `govulncheck` (actual exploitability analysis) and one running your test suite against latest deps. The case study: Dependabot opened thousands of PRs for a one-line Go fix in a method literally no one uses, including PRs against repos that didn't even import the affected package — all with fake AI-generated CVSS scores.

**So what:** Your repos (Mission Control, Pal Web, Pal Field App) likely have Dependabot enabled by default via GitHub. Directly applicable: (1) Turn off Dependabot security alerts on your repos — they are noisy and the false-positive rate is high enough to cause alert fatigue, which is worse than no alerts. (2) Replace with a weekly GitHub Actions workflow running `npm audit --audit-level=high` against your actual dependency tree. This gives you signal, not noise. For Mission Control specifically, a "real" vulnerability will actually surface and get fixed rather than being buried in 20 irrelevant PRs.

### 8. `aquasecurity/trivy` — Container + Code Vulnerability Scanner on GitHub Trending
**Relevance: 7/10** `#security` `#infrastructure` `#docker`
**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) · [trivy.dev](https://trivy.dev)

Trivy is on GitHub Trending again — it scans containers, Kubernetes manifests, code repos, cloud configs, and IaC for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, secrets, and generates SBOMs. Single binary, zero config for basic use. Scans Docker images before push: `trivy image myapp:latest`. A "Next-Gen Trivy" is announced for 2026 with expanded coverage.

**So what:** If you're running Docker containers for any self-hosted services (Mission Control API, chat responder, monitoring), Trivy is the easiest way to check them for known CVEs before they run in production. One-liner to add to your deploy pipeline: `trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL myimage:tag`. Also useful for scanning your GitHub repos for accidentally committed secrets — `trivy repo .` — worth running on all three repos now.

## 🛠️ Dev Tools / Infrastructure

### 9. `blackboardsh/electrobun` — TypeScript Desktop Apps, 14MB vs Electron's 100MB+
**Relevance: 6/10** `#tools` `#typescript` `#desktop`
**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/blackboardsh/electrobun) · [v1 Announcement](https://blackboard.sh/blog/electrobun-v1/)

Electrobun v1 just shipped — a TypeScript-first desktop app framework built on Zig + Bun + native WebViews. Benchmarks vs Electron: ~14MB compressed bundle vs 100MB+, <50ms cold start vs 2-5s, 14KB update patches vs 100MB+ full downloads. Pure TypeScript for both main process and UI. Zero Node.js — uses Bun's runtime. Built by one person over two years, requiring learning Zig, C, C++, and Objective-C along the way.

**So what:** Not immediately relevant to your stack, but worth knowing for one scenario: if Mission Control ever needs a native desktop companion app (sync daemon, local agent runner, offline mode), Electrobun is a far more practical choice than Electron. The 14KB patch updates are especially compelling for a field-deployed desktop tool where bandwidth matters. File under "when you need a desktop app."

### 10. `Effect-TS/effect-smol` — Effect v4 Core (Experimental)
**Relevance: 5/10** `#typescript` `#libraries`
**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol)

Effect v4's experimental core library is on GitHub Trending. Effect is a TypeScript functional programming library focused on composable error handling, dependency injection, and concurrency — essentially a typed runtime for TypeScript applications. `effect-smol` is the stripped-down v4 core being developed in the open.

**So what:** Effect has a steep learning curve but solves real problems in complex TypeScript backends: typed errors that can't be silently swallowed, structured concurrency, and DI without decorators. If Convex ever becomes a bottleneck and you need a custom backend layer, Effect v4 would be the right foundation. Low priority for now — monitor as v4 stabilizes.
