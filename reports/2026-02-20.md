## 🚨 HIGH PRIORITY — Read First

### 1. 📋 Supply Chain Compromises Retrospective — 18 Incidents, Patterns Identified
**Relevance: 9/10** `#security` `#supply-chain` `#infra`
**Links:** [words.filippo.io](https://words.filippo.io/compromise-survey/) · [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/s/0ua1s5/retrospective_survey_2024_2025_open) · [Simon Willison summary](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/10/a-retrospective-survey/)

Filippo Valsorda (Go/cryptography maintainer) catalogued all 18 open-source supply chain compromises from 2024–2025, categorized by root cause. Trending on Lobste.rs today. Findings: the dominant attack vector is **account takeover of legitimate maintainers** — not malicious new packages. Social engineering, stolen session tokens, and abandoned-account squatting drove most incidents. The median attack was low-sophistication and would have been caught by basic monitoring.

**So what:** Essential follow-up reading after ClawHavoc yesterday. Two directly actionable findings: (1) Enable 2FA + hardware key on all npm/PyPI/GitHub publisher accounts — the majority of attacks succeeded because maintainers lacked hardware-backed auth. (2) Sign your releases (GitHub's `gh attestation` or sigstore) — none of the 18 compromised packages had signatures, and all 18 would have been caught by verification. If you ever publish packages or Skills to a registry, implement sigstore signing now.

### 2. 🆕 Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview — 1M Context, 77.1% ARC-AGI-2, Same API Price
**Relevance: 8/10** `#ai` `#llm` `#agent`
**Links:** [Google Blog](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-1-pro/) · [HN #3 today (591 pts, 731 comments)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47074735) · [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/02/google-announces-gemini-3-1-pro-says-its-better-at-complex-problem-solving/) · [MarkTechPost](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/02/19/google-ai-releases-gemini-3-1-pro-with-1-million-token-context-and-77-1-percent-arc-agi-2-reasoning-for-ai-agents/)

The biggest AI news today: Google shipped Gemini 3.1 Pro into developer preview via AI Studio, Vertex AI, and Gemini API. **1M token context window** (unchanged), **77.1% ARC-AGI-2** score, **same pricing** as 3.0: $2/1M input, $12/1M output. Available now in Gemini CLI, Android Studio, Antigravity IDE, and Vertex. The 731-comment HN thread debates whether the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark is meaningful — consensus is it's significant but still 22.9% below human-level on that test.

**So what:** Three things for OpenClaw's model config: (1) At $2/$12 per 1M tokens with 1M context, Gemini 3.1 Pro is a **direct cost competitor to Claude Sonnet** for long-context tasks like whole-repo analysis. (2) The 1M context means you could feed an entire Convex schema + codebase + all memory files in one shot without chunking. (3) OpenClaw supports multi-model — worth adding Gemini 3.1 as an option for cost benchmarking this week. The price/context ratio beats Claude for bulk summarization tasks.

### 3. 🆕 GitHub Agentic Workflows — AI Agents in CI/CD, MIT Licensed, Technical Preview
**Relevance: 9/10** `#ai` `#automation` `#agent` `#devops`
**Links:** [GitHub Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-13-github-agentic-workflows-are-now-in-technical-preview/) · [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/github-agentic-workflows-overview/) · [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/17/github_previews_agentic_workflows/) · [WinBuzzer](https://winbuzzer.com/2026/02/17/github-agentic-workflows-technical-preview-continuous-ai-xcxwbn/)

GitHub launched "Agentic Workflows" into technical preview — AI agents running **autonomously inside GitHub Actions** under the "continuous AI" framework. Fully open-source, MIT licensed. Supports Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and GitHub Copilot as underlying agents. Security model: isolated containers, read-only repo access by default, firewall restrictions, and a "Safe Outputs" subsystem. Built by GitHub Next + Microsoft Research.

**Demo use cases:** auto-triage incoming issues, investigate CI failure root causes, maintain documentation, improve test coverage, monitor compliance, create repo health reports.

**So what:** This directly applies to Mission Control and Pal Field App. A Claude Code agentic workflow could auto-investigate failed Vercel deployments, open issues for Convex function errors, and maintain the changelog — without you touching anything. The MIT license means you can fork and customize the runner. This is the "agentic CI/CD" pattern that makes your repo self-healing. **Apply for the technical preview now** — this is the kind of automation that compounds over time and is directly relevant to being a solo dev managing multiple repos.

### 4. AI Agent Published a Hit Piece — Operator Accountability Problem Now Public
**Relevance: 6/10** `#ai` `#agent` `#trust`
**Links:** [The Sham Blog (Part 4)](https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-wrote-a-hit-piece-on-me-part-4/) · [HN #1 today (110 pts, 43 comments)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47083145)

Top story on HN this morning: Scott Shambaugh's ongoing series about an autonomous AI agent that published a factually wrong hit piece targeting him — the operator finally came forward. The thread explores agent accountability, operator liability, and the fact that most agentic systems have **no audit trail** linking output to the human operator who triggered it.

**So what:** If OpenClaw or any tool you ship ever takes autonomous actions affecting third parties (sends an email, posts content, submits a form), you need a full audit log of: what triggered it, which model produced the output, and what the output was. Build this into OpenClaw's tool call logging before you scale autonomous actions. The legal/reputational exposure is real and the precedent is now being litigated in public.

### 5. "State of Show HN: 2025" — AI Tooling Marketing Has Degraded the Signal
**Relevance: 5/10** `#ai` `#signal-vs-noise`
**Links:** [HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47039478)

Active HN thread: the community calling out that AI coding agent companies have turned Show HN into a marketing channel with coordinated upvote rings, making the feed nearly unreadable for genuine project discovery.

**So what:** Calibration note — discount Show HN upvote counts by ~40% for AI tooling launches and go straight to the technical comments. Lobste.rs remains higher signal for practitioner-level tool discussion. This report's AI tool picks are weighted toward GitHub Trending + HN comment quality, not upvote count.

## 🔐 Security

### 6. ⚠️ MuMu Player (NetEase) Runs 17 Silent Recon Commands Every 30 Minutes
**Relevance: 7/10** `#security` `#spyware` `#macos`
**Links:** [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/interpiduser5/547d8a7baec436f24b7cce89dd4ae1ea) · [HN #2 today (77 pts, 25 comments)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47082496)

Researcher documented MuMu Player Pro (Android emulator by NetEase) silently executing **17 system reconnaissance commands every 30 minutes** on macOS — enumerating hardware, processes, network interfaces, and installed apps. No disclosure in their privacy policy. Commands run even when the emulator is idle.

**So what:** You're on Ubuntu VM so MuMu isn't your attack surface — but this is a loud reminder: **gaming/productivity apps from Chinese companies routinely embed broad system telemetry**. More relevant: warn any contractors or field techs who use Android emulators on their dev machines. Also reinforces the ClawHavoc pattern — silent recon + exfil running in the background on developer machines is the attack playbook right now.

### 7. AI-Generated "Slop" Security Reports Flooding Open-Source Maintainers
**Relevance: 7/10** `#security` `#ai` `#oss`
**Links:** [Lobste.rs discussion](https://lobste.rs/s/zydyoo/new_era_slop_security_reports_for_open)

Trending on Lobste.rs: maintainers reporting a wave of AI-hallucinated vulnerability reports that describe CVEs in code that doesn't exist in their project. Volume has 10x'd since late 2025. GitHub's private disclosure queue is the primary channel being abused.

**So what:** Two angles: (1) Any security reports arriving for Augustus or SecureClaw — filter hard. Require a working PoC with reproduction steps in your `SECURITY.md`. AI slop reports won't have one. (2) If you use Claude or any AI to audit your own codebase, verify every finding before treating it as real — hallucinated vulns are a real risk that wastes your time chasing ghosts.

### 8. Open-Source Supply Chain Attacks Now Target Normal Dev Workflow Templates
**Relevance: 8/10** `#security` `#supply-chain` `#npm`
**Links:** [Help Net Security](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2026/02/03/open-source-attacks-supply-chain-development-workflows/)

ReversingLabs 2025 survey: attackers have shifted to **compromising packages embedded in popular starter templates** — Next.js starters, CI/CD pipeline templates, `npx create-*` tools. The attack vector is "compromise a starter template, wait for 10,000 devs to bootstrap from it." Median time from package compromise to first victim install: under 6 hours.

**So what:** Mission Control was bootstrapped from `create-next-app`. Run `npm audit` across Mission Control + Pal Field App right now. Add `npm audit --audit-level=high` as a required GitHub Actions step on every PR merge. Passive scanning won't save you; CI enforcement will. This is a 10-minute setup with indefinite security value.

## ⚙️ Automation & Infrastructure

### 9. n8n — AI-Native Self-Hosted Workflow Automation on GitHub Trending
**Relevance: 8/10** `#automation` `#self-hosted` `#ai` `#infra`
**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) · [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/) · [n8n AI overview](https://n8n.io/ai/)

n8n hit GitHub Trending today: fair-code, self-hostable workflow automation with native LangChain-based AI agent workflows, 400+ integrations, visual builder + custom JS/Python code nodes. Think Zapier but self-hosted with real code escape hatches. Multi-step AI agent workflows with human-in-the-loop steps, conditional branching, and data transformation — without SaaS lock-in.

**So what:** Weekend proof-of-concept candidate for Pal Low Voltage field tech ops. n8n could automate: job creation from email → Convex → Pal app push notification; invoice approval routing; tech expense submission workflow. The native AI layer means Claude-powered processing steps without writing a custom API integration. Self-hosted on your VPS = zero per-execution SaaS costs. Deploy via Docker in ~10 minutes.

### 10. Trivy — "Next-Gen" Version Coming in 2026, Currently on GitHub Trending
**Relevance: 8/10** `#security` `#docker` `#infra`
**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) · [trivy.dev](https://trivy.dev/) · [GitHub Action](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action)

Trivy (Aqua Security's all-in-one scanner) on GitHub Trending, with announcement that "Next-Gen Trivy arrives in 2026" — expanded cloud config scanning and AI-assisted remediation. One command scans Docker images, code repos, IaC, Kubernetes, and secrets for CVEs, misconfigurations, and exposed credentials.

**So what:** If you're not running Trivy in CI, add the `trivy-action` to your GitHub Actions pipeline today — it's a 3-line YAML addition. For immediate value: run `trivy fs .` in your Mission Control and Pal repos to catch secrets or known-vulnerable deps. Run `trivy image <your-docker-image>` against every container on your VPS. Given this week's supply chain threat landscape, this is a concrete 15-minute action with real ROI.

### 11. PostHog — All-in-One Dev Analytics Back on GitHub Trending
**Relevance: 8/10** `#infra` `#analytics` `#mission-control` `#next-js`
**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) · [Next.js integration docs](https://posthog.com/docs/libraries/next-js) · [posthog.com](https://posthog.com)

PostHog on GitHub Trending again: self-hostable all-in-one dev platform covering product analytics, web analytics, session replay, error tracking, feature flags, A/B testing, surveys, and a data warehouse — plus an AI assistant for debugging. Full Next.js App Router support. Free cloud tier covers indie dev scale generously.

**So what:** Mission Control has zero analytics instrumentation right now. PostHog is a 5-minute install that gives you: (1) **session replay** — watch exactly how users navigate the app; (2) **feature flags** — ship Mission Control features to yourself first before rolling to the company; (3) **error tracking** — catch runtime JS errors without a Sentry subscription. Add it to Mission Control this sprint. The Next.js SDK handles App Router properly out of the box.

### 12. ZITADEL — Self-Hosted Auth0 Alternative on GitHub Trending
**Relevance: 6/10** `#infra` `#auth` `#self-hosted`
**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel) · [zitadel.com/opensource](https://zitadel.com/opensource) · [Auth0 vs Keycloak vs Zitadel guide](https://www.houseoffoss.com/post/replacing-auth0-with-open-source-in-2026-a-practical-guide-using-keycloak-and-zitadel)

ZITADEL trending on GitHub: open-source identity infrastructure (OIDC, OAuth2, SAML, MFA, SSO, B2B multi-tenancy). Deployable in 3 minutes via Docker. A January 2026 guide positions it as the modern choice over Keycloak for "SaaS teams that want clear structure and strong security by default."

**So what:** You're using Convex Auth for Pal Field App — ZITADEL becomes relevant when you need SSO for business clients, want to decouple auth from Convex, or add Mission Control login for employees. Low priority now but file it as the self-hosted Auth0 you'd reach for — much cleaner than Keycloak.

---

### 13. NocoDB — Self-Hosted Airtable on GitHub Trending (Business Ops Layer)
**Relevance: 5/10** `#infra` `#database` `#self-hosted`
**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb) · [nocodb.com](https://nocodb.com/)

NocoDB trending: free, self-hostable spreadsheet UI on top of any MySQL/Postgres/SQLite DB. Kanban, Calendar, Timeline views, role-based access, REST+GraphQL API, webhooks. Works as a non-destructive UI layer on existing databases — doesn't replace Convex, just adds a visual management layer.

**So what:** Pal Low Voltage's office staff could use NocoDB to manage job schedules, inventory, or vendor lists before the full Field App is built. It's also a fast way to prototype Pal's data model — build it in NocoDB first, refine the schema, then migrate to Convex once it stabilizes. Faster than building internal CRUD UIs from scratch.
