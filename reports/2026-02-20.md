## 🤖 AI

### 1. 🚨 `anthropics/claude-plugins-official` — Official Claude Code Plugin Marketplace Launched
**Relevance: 10/10** `#ai` `#agent` `#openclaw` `#claude`
**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official) · [Plugin structure docs](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/plugins/README.md)

Anthropic just shipped an official, Anthropic-curated plugin directory for Claude Code — on GitHub Trending today. Structure: `/plugins` (Anthropic-built) and `/external_plugins` (community/partner submissions). Each plugin follows a standard schema: `plugin.json` metadata, optional MCP server config (`.mcp.json`), slash commands, agent definitions, and skills. Install via:
```
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```
External plugins can be submitted for review and inclusion. Quality + security standards required for approval.

**So what:** This is the most directly relevant thing to OpenClaw in weeks. This is exactly what OpenClaw Skills are — composable, installable agent capabilities packaged as directories. Two immediate actions: (1) Study the `plugin.json` schema and adopt it as the canonical format for OpenClaw Skills to ensure compatibility with the Claude ecosystem. (2) The `superpowers` skill (see below) is installable right now from this marketplace — try it today. The marketplace pattern Anthropic chose (GitHub-hosted, YAML metadata, MCP wiring) validates OpenClaw's architecture direction.

### 2. 🆕 `obra/superpowers` — Agentic Dev Workflow Framework on GitHub Trending
**Relevance: 9/10** `#ai` `#agent` `#openclaw` `#skills`
**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) · [Claude Plugin Marketplace](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official)

Trending hard today. Superpowers is a complete software development workflow built on composable "skills" — it gives coding agents a structured methodology: spec extraction → design review → implementation plan → subagent-driven TDD execution. Key differentiator: it's not a prompt, it's a *process*. Once installed, the agent automatically applies the workflow without being asked. Supports Claude Code, Cursor, Codex. Installable from the new official plugin marketplace.

The core loop: agent specs out what you want → you approve in chunks → it writes a plan "clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste" → subagents execute each task with TDD → self-review. Author claims Claude can work autonomously for 2+ hours without deviating.

**So what:** Two angles. (1) Install and use Superpowers in Claude Code for your next Mission Control or Pal Web feature — the spec-first workflow alone is worth it; it prevents the "agent dives into code before understanding the problem" failure mode. (2) The skill structure (composable, auto-triggering, methodology-as-code) is the exact pattern to evolve OpenClaw Skills toward. The `SKILL.md` trigger system already works this way — Superpowers validates you're on the right track and shows where to go next.

### 3. 🆕 Stripe Minions Part 2 — 1,300+ PRs/Week from Fully Unattended Coding Agents
**Relevance: 8/10** `#ai` `#agent` `#automation`
**Links:** [stripe.dev blog](https://stripe.dev/blog/minions-stripes-one-shot-end-to-end-coding-agents-part-2) · [HN 41 pts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47085200)

Published yesterday, Stripe's Part 2 details how Minions — their fully unattended internal coding agents — now generate 1,300+ PRs per week. Fully autonomous, one-shot (they tackle tasks start-to-finish with no human in the loop). They fix flaky tests, implement features, and write code from scratch. Humans only review, not write. Built internally by Stripe's "Leverage" team.

**So what:** The operational model Stripe describes is the end-state for how OpenClaw should run: agent assigned a task → produces a complete PR → human reviews → merge. You're already doing this with `sessions_spawn` and `gh` CLI. What Stripe's writeup adds: their evaluation harness for agent quality (does the agent's code actually pass CI?) and their escalation path (when agents get stuck, they log and stop rather than hallucinating forward). Both patterns are worth adopting in OpenClaw's subagent architecture.

### 4. 🆕 Consistency Diffusion Language Models (CDLM) — 14.5x Faster Inference, No Quality Loss
**Relevance: 7/10** `#ai` `#llm` `#inference`
**Links:** [Together.ai blog](https://www.together.ai/blog/consistency-diffusion-language-models) · [HN 157 pts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47080221)

Together.ai published a post-training technique called CDLM today — combining consistency-based multi-token finalization with block-wise KV caching. Result: **14.5x latency speedup on coding and math tasks** with no measurable quality degradation. Demonstrated on Llama-class models. Open technique, not a proprietary system.

**So what:** If CDLM gets applied to Claude or Gemini models at the API level (which is likely given Together.ai's provider relationships), your OpenClaw agent tasks that currently take 3 minutes could run in under 15 seconds. More practically: when evaluating local LLM options for tasks you currently pay Claude API rates for, CDLM-optimized models on Together.ai become a serious option. Bookmark and revisit in 30 days when adoption starts showing up in API providers.

### 5. `ComposioHQ/composio` — 1,000+ Pre-Built Agent Toolkits on GitHub Trending
**Relevance: 7/10** `#ai` `#agent` `#openclaw` `#automation`
**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio) · [composio.dev](https://composio.dev)

Composio is an open-source framework that gives AI agents 1,000+ pre-built tool integrations (Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Linear, Notion, HubSpot, etc.) with managed authentication, context management, and a sandboxed workbench. You wire it to any LLM with a few lines of code. The auth layer handles OAuth flows for all integrations automatically — agents can take actions in connected apps without you building the auth plumbing.

**So what:** The value isn't the individual integrations — it's the **managed auth for agents**. Right now, when OpenClaw needs to interact with a new service, you write a custom auth flow. Composio provides this as a library. Relevant for when you want OpenClaw to automatically interact with Convex admin panel, send Slack notifications, or manage GitHub issues without manually wiring OAuth. Worth a spike to see if Composio's tool calling format is compatible with Claude's tool use API.

### 6. "AI Is an Exoskeleton, Not a Coworker" — 343 pts on HN
**Relevance: 6/10** `#ai` `#product`
**Links:** [kasava.dev](https://kasava.dev) · [HN 343 pts, 381 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47076892)

Third-highest HN story today. The thesis: framing AI as a coworker sets wrong expectations (reliability, accountability, autonomy). Framing it as an exoskeleton is more accurate — it amplifies *your* capabilities, moves when you move, stops when you stop, and fails in predictable ways when misused. The coworker framing leads to disappointment; the exoskeleton framing leads to better tool design.

**So what:** Directly applicable to both Pal Field App and Pal Web. If you add AI features (job logging, anomaly detection, invoice summaries), frame them as **augmenting the human's decision** rather than **replacing it**. The exoskeleton frame also clarifies where to draw the automation line: autonomous invoice approval is a coworker task (risky), but AI-flagged anomalies that a human approves is an exoskeleton task (correct). Use this as a design principle for Pal's AI features.

## 🔐 Security

### 7. `vxcontrol/pentagi` — Autonomous AI Pentesting Agents on GitHub Trending #1
**Relevance: 8/10** `#security` `#ai` `#agent`
**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/vxcontrol/pentagi) · [README](https://github.com/vxcontrol/pentagi/blob/master/README.md)

Today's #1 trending GitHub repo: Pentagi is a fully autonomous AI agent system built specifically for penetration testing. Docker-deployed, supports multiple LLM backends (Claude, GPT-4, etc.), has a purpose-built test harness (`ctester`) that runs agents through structured evaluation scenarios, and produces test reports. Agent types: `simple`, `primary_agent`, `pentester`. Can be run in existing containers.

**So what:** Three angles: (1) **Direct security use:** Point Pentagi at your own VPS and Convex endpoints as a periodic autonomous security scan — it'll probe attack surfaces in ways static scanners miss. (2) **Architecture study:** The `ctester` agent evaluation harness is exactly what OpenClaw needs for validating subagent behavior before trusting it with real tasks. Study how Pentagi structures agent test groups. (3) **Threat model:** If autonomous pentesting agents are now commodity open source tools, assume your exposed endpoints (Convex site, Vercel routes) are being actively probed with AI agents. Review your API key scoping and rate limiting.

### 8. ⚠️ Silicon Valley Engineers Indicted for Sending Trade Secrets to Iran
**Relevance: 7/10** `#security` `#infra` `#insider-threat`
**Links:** [CNBC](https://cnbc.com) · [HN 36 pts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47086100)

Breaking today: DOJ indicted two Silicon Valley engineers for allegedly exfiltrating proprietary AI/chip design IP to Iran-linked actors. Method: standard exfil via personal cloud storage and messaging apps during normal work hours.

**So what:** Not directly about your setup, but the exfil vector is relevant. In your context: (1) Any contractor or future hire with access to your Convex environment, Clerk admin, or GitHub org is a potential insider threat. (2) Audit who has what access right now — GitHub org members, Clerk dashboard access, Convex deployment keys. (3) The `SECURITY.md` you're adding to repos should include an offboarding checklist (revoke tokens, remove from Clerk org, rotate any shared credentials). Small team doesn't mean low insider risk.

## ⚙️ Automation & Infrastructure

### 9. "I Built My Startup on European Infrastructure" — HN #1 Today (463 pts)
**Relevance: 7/10** `#infra` `#self-hosted` `#docker`
**Links:** [coinerella.com](https://www.coinerella.com/made-in-eu-it-was-harder-than-i-thought/) · [HN 463 pts, 236 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47085483)

Today's top HN story: a solo founder documents their attempt to run their entire startup on EU-based infrastructure (GDPR-compliant, no US big tech dependencies). Stack they landed on: **Hetzner** (compute — half the price of AWS, ARM and x86 available), **Cloudflare R2** (object storage with EU data residency option), **Coolify** (self-hosted Heroku alternative for deployments), **Plausible** (analytics). What they couldn't avoid: Stripe for payments, Cloudflare for DDoS protection.

**So what:** Directly relevant to your VPS strategy. Three takeaways: (1) **Coolify** is the deployment layer you're missing — it gives you a Heroku-style `git push` deploy for your self-hosted services with rollback, env var management, and monitoring baked in. Better than raw Docker Compose for managing multiple services. (2) **Hetzner** is significantly cheaper than your current VPS if you're on DigitalOcean or Vultr — ARM instances at 4 vCPU/8GB for ~€6/month. (3) The article's main lesson: self-hosting is viable but the long tail of dependencies (payments, CDN, email) always points back to US-hosted SaaS. Know where your hard dependencies are.

### 10. "Infrastructure Decisions I Endorse or Regret After 4 Years" — Resurfaced (320 pts)
**Relevance: 7/10** `#infra` `#architecture`
**Links:** [cep.dev](https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/) · [HN 320 pts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47043345)

This cep.dev post from 2024 keeps resurfacing on HN with fresh engagement — it hit 320 pts today, suggesting the community keeps finding it relevant. Key endorsements: Postgres over everything (including Redis for most jobs), Kubernetes was worth it (even for small teams), managed databases early, feature flags on day one. Key regrets: self-hosted auth (use a provider), NAT gateways (just use VPC), over-engineering data pipelines early.

**So what:** The "self-hosted auth" regret is directly relevant — you're using Clerk (correct call). The "managed DB early" advice aligns with Convex (correct call). The **feature flags on day one** regret stands out: you already have PostHog's feature flags available once you install it in Mission Control/Pal Web (it was in yesterday's report). Do it now, not later — retroactively adding feature flags to a codebase is painful. The Postgres-over-everything advice doesn't apply (Convex handles your persistence), but it validates the choice to not introduce Redis, Elasticsearch, or other secondary stores.

### 11. Taalas HC1 — Custom Silicon at 17,000 Tokens/Sec Per User
**Relevance: 6/10** `#ai` `#inference` `#hardware`
**Links:** [taalas.com](https://taalas.com/products/) · [HN 318 pts, 219 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47082991)

Today's second-highest HN story: Taalas, a startup building custom AI inference silicon, demonstrated 17,000 tokens/second per user on Llama — compared to ~60 tokens/sec on typical cloud API infrastructure. The "path to ubiquitous AI" thesis: when inference is this fast and cheap, AI moves from cloud API calls to real-time, interactive, always-on experiences.

**So what:** The 17k tokens/sec number is striking in the context of field tech tooling. Right now, Claude-powered features in Pal Field App feel like "send a request, wait for a response." At 17k tokens/sec, AI feels instantaneous — voice transcription, real-time form suggestions, instant job cost estimates. This hardware won't be in your hands soon, but it maps the trajectory: the AI features worth building now are those that get better as inference gets faster. Design AI features in Pal that assume eventual instant inference even if they feel slow today.

## 📌 Also on the Radar

- **`huggingface/skills`** (GitHub Trending) — HuggingFace's skills repository, very new with minimal docs. Watch for what they publish here as it relates to agent capability packaging — likely complements their Hub tools.
- **`google-research/timesfm`** (GitHub Trending) — Google's pretrained time-series foundation model. Relevant if you add predictive job scheduling or invoice forecasting to Pal Web (predict how many jobs a tech will complete based on historical patterns).
- **`blackboardsh/electrobun`** (GitHub Trending) — TypeScript desktop app framework (like Electron but fast). Not relevant to your stack but worth knowing exists.
- **"defer in gcc/clang"** (HN 215 pts) — C-style defer (like Go's defer) now available in both major C compilers. Niche but signals that systems-level language ergonomics are improving across the board.
- **FreeCAD trending** (HN 252 pts) — The open-source CAD tool hit a stable 1.0 release and the community is excited. Not relevant to your stack.
- **`databricks-solutions/ai-dev-kit`** (GitHub Trending) — Databricks' coding agent toolkit for Databricks-hosted projects. Not relevant unless you add ML infrastructure.
