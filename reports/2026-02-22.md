## 🚨 CRITICAL — Security (Direct Hits to Your Setup)

### 1. 🔥 Infostealer Malware Now Actively Targeting OpenClaw Config Files & Gateway Tokens
**Relevance: 10/10** `#security` `#openclaw` `#infostealer` `#immediate`
**Links:** [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/infostealer-steals-openclaw-ai-agent.html) · [Security Affairs](https://securityaffairs.com/188097/malware/hackers-steal-openclaw-configuration-in-emerging-ai-agent-threat.html) · [CyberInsider](https://cyberinsider.com/infostealer-malware-now-targeting-openclaw-ai-environments/) · [eSecurity Planet](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/threats/infostealers-target-openclaw-ai-configuration-files/)

Infostealers are now specifically capturing OpenClaw AI agent environments. The stolen file set includes: **`openclaw.json`** (gateway authentication token, email, workspace path), **`device.json`** (private cryptographic keys), and **soul/memory markdown files** (agent behavioral config and personal context). This wasn't a targeted OpenClaw module — a broad file-grabbing routine looking for sensitive extensions and directory names accidentally scooped up the entire OpenClaw environment. Multiple victims confirmed.

**So what:** This is the most directly relevant story in weeks. Three actions right now: **(1)** Your `~/.openclaw` directory is the exact target. Ensure your Mac doesn't have any infostealers — run `malwarebytes` or equivalent on the Mac Mini host. **(2)** The gateway token in `openclaw.json` is what lets an attacker control your OpenClaw instance remotely — rotate your gateway token after ensuring the Mac is clean. **(3)** The "soul and memory files" being leaked means an attacker would get your SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, and daily notes — everything about how you use OpenClaw, your projects, your credentials references. This is a strong argument for keeping MEMORY.md minimal and not logging actual secret values there.

### 2. 🔴 Starkiller Phishing-as-a-Service — Bypasses MFA by Proxying the Real Login Page
**Relevance: 9/10** `#security` `#phishing` `#mfa` `#pal-field-app`
**Links:** [Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/02/starkiller-phishing-service-proxies-real-login-pages-mfa/) · [Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/starkiller-phishing-kit-mfa) · [Infosecurity Magazine](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/starkiller-phishing-kit-bypasses/)

**Starkiller** is a new commercial phishing-as-a-service platform that defeats MFA by acting as a transparent proxy in front of the real login page. When a victim is phished, they're authenticating against the *actual* Clerk/Google/Microsoft site through Starkiller's reverse proxy — the phishing service captures their session token in real time. The GUI makes it trivially accessible to low-skill attackers: URL masking, session hijacking, container lifecycle management, all automated. Brian Krebs broke the story.

**So what:** Standard TOTP or SMS MFA doesn't protect against this — the attacker captures the live session. The only protection that works is **hardware security keys** (FIDO2/passkeys), which are phishing-resistant because they verify the origin domain. For Pal Field App specifically: Clerk supports passkeys. When Pal goes live with real users, consider strongly encouraging (or requiring) passkey enrollment over TOTP. For your own accounts: your Anthropic, GitHub, Convex, and Vercel accounts should all use hardware key MFA if you have a YubiKey.

### 3. 🔴 MCP Servers Have a Critical RCE Flaw — 10,000+ Servers Potentially Affected
**Relevance: 8/10** `#security` `#mcp` `#rce` `#ai`
**Links:** [CyberPress](https://cyberpress.org/mcp-servers-expose-data-risk/) · [Medium — MCP State of the Ecosystem](https://medium.com/@amilasilvapvt/how-the-model-context-protocol-is-about-to-reshape-the-way-humanity-buys-sells-and-lives-104be36ddef3)

A critical remote code execution vulnerability was disclosed in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation. MCP has exploded to **10,000+ published servers** as the de-facto standard for connecting AI models to external tools (Slack, databases, APIs). The flaw allows a malicious MCP server to execute arbitrary code in the client that connects to it — meaning if you connect OpenClaw or Claude to a compromised or malicious MCP server, your machine is owned.

**So what:** You're not running MCP servers currently, so direct risk is low. But watch the MCP server ecosystem carefully before adding any. If you ever wire Mission Control or Pal Web to Claude via MCP tools, make sure those MCP servers are self-hosted (not third-party). The 10,000-server number with essentially zero security review is a supply chain attack waiting to happen.

### 4. 🔴 20 AI App Data Breaches Since 2025 — All the Same Three Root Causes
**Relevance: 8/10** `#security` `#saas` `#pal-field-app` `#pal-web`
**Links:** [Barrack.ai](https://blog.barrack.ai/every-ai-app-data-breach-2025-2026/)

Barrack.ai catalogued every documented AI application security incident since January 2025 — 20 total, tens of millions of users exposed. The root causes are identical across every breach: **(1) missing or misconfigured authentication**, **(2) API keys hardcoded, committed, or left in public-facing configs**, **(3) misconfigured user permissions (any user can access any data)**.

**So what:** These are exactly the failure modes to audit in Pal before launch. Specific checklist: **(1)** Convex row-level access rules — does every query verify the caller's identity? **(2)** Are your Convex and Clerk keys anywhere in the repo (check with `git log -S "your_key_string"`)?  **(3)** Can a tech see another tech's invoices or mileage records? Each of these is a GDPR/liability issue for a real company. Run Claude Code Security scan (from last night's report) across all three repos this week.

### 5. 🔥 AI Cuts Time-to-Exfiltration From 4.8 Hours to 1.2 Hours — Unit 42 2026 Report
**Relevance: 9/10** `#security` `#ai` `#threat-intel`
**Links:** [Medium — Unit 42 Summary](https://medium.com/@garvithaswani28/the-5-ai-hacking-tools-black-hats-are-unleashing-in-2026-and-how-to-survive-them-5c5234c2f9ab)

Unit 42's 2026 threat report confirms the fastest 25% of intrusions now reach data exfiltration in **1.2 hours**, down from 4.8 hours the prior year. The mechanism: AI is now being used to automate the "monitor → diff → test → weaponize" loop in real time. Once an attacker is in, AI tooling finds the valuable data and exfiltrates before a human analyst could even open a SIEM alert.

**So what:** Detection and response speed now matters more than it ever has. If Pal Field App stores tech payroll data, SSNs, or bank routing info, a breach response that takes 4 hours is now a complete loss — not a near miss. Your Convex deployment has logs. Set up alerting for anomalous query patterns (bulk data reads across all users from a new IP) before you store anything sensitive.

### 6. "The Most Popular AI Agent Is a Security Catastrophe" — OpenClaw in the Spotlight
**Relevance: 8/10** `#openclaw` `#security` `#ai`
**Links:** [DEV Community](https://dev.to/mothasa/the-most-popular-ai-agent-on-github-is-a-security-catastrophe-415m)

A viral DEV Community post calls OpenClaw (described as "formerly Clawdbot, then Moltbot") the fastest-growing open-source project in GitHub history and dissects its security model. The article's thesis: OpenClaw grants AI agents access to your full environment — email, files, calendar, code, shell — and has been architected for capability rather than containment. The ClawHub skill marketplace (with ~20% malicious skills) is cited as the most critical vector.

**So what:** You're already well-positioned against most of the attack vectors named (zero ClawHub skills, hardened Ubuntu VM, iptables blocking inbound, secrets at chmod 600). The one open item: the article's recommendation to **run agent-executed code in a container or sandbox** (similar to NanoClaw's architecture) isn't something OpenClaw does by default. The `ajail` tool mentioned in an earlier report is a practical implementation of this for your setup.

### 7. AI Is Generating Open Source Spam at Scale — HN Discussion
**Relevance: 7/10** `#opensource` `#ai` `#devtools`
**Links:** [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47042136)

A heavily-upvoted HN thread discusses how AI-generated pull requests, issues, and README rewrites are flooding popular open source repos, creating a signal-to-noise problem that's making maintainers burn out. The data: visitor rates to many established open source projects dropped sharply post-ChatGPT, while issue/PR volume spiked. Quality of contributions degraded simultaneously.

**So what:** Directly relevant for your three repos. When you open them up to external contributors (post-launch), this is already the environment. The GitHub Agentic Workflows feature (from last night's report) includes AI-powered issue triage specifically because maintainers can't keep up with AI-generated noise. Set up issue templates and a contribution guide early so AI-generated spam hits a filter.

### 8. Self-Host Weekly — Discord Charging for Community Features, Alternatives Being Explored
**Relevance: 6/10** `#selfhosted` `#infra` `#community`
**Links:** [selfh.st/weekly/2026-02-13](https://selfh.st/weekly/2026-02-13/)

The self-hosted community is reacting to Discord's announcement of paid tiers for community server features (search, extended history, analytics). Self-hosted alternatives gaining ground: **Revolt** (Rust-based, fully OSS), **Spacebar** (open Discord protocol implementation), **Matrix/Element** (federated, enterprise-grade). The FOSS community that built their communities on Discord is now evaluating exits.

**So what:** Not urgent for Pal Field App, which uses Clerk for auth and Convex for messaging. But if you ever spin up a community or support channel for Pal users, avoid Discord lock-in from the start. The Pal Field App already has a built-in messaging system via Convex — that's the right architecture for field tech communication.
