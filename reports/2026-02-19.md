## 🤖 AI

### 1. Claude Sonnet 4.6 — Anthropic
**Relevance: 9/10** `#ai` `#models` `#openclaw`
**Links:** [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/anthropic-ai-claude-sonnet-4-6-default-free-pro.html) · [GitHub Copilot Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-17-claude-sonnet-4-6-is-now-generally-available-in-github-copilot/) · [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/anthropic-releases-claude-sonnet-4-6/)

Released Feb 17. Opus-class coding performance at Sonnet pricing — Anthropic's own words: "performance that would have previously required reaching for an Opus-class model is now available with Sonnet 4.6." Key upgrades: much-improved coding + computer use, 1M token context window, now the default model for Free and Pro tiers. Rolling out in GitHub Copilot with a 1x premium request multiplier.

**So what:** This is the model you're running on right now. The coding and agentic improvements are directly relevant to OpenClaw task quality. If you have any evals or benchmarks for your agent workflows, re-run them — there may be measurable gains. Context window jumping to 1M is also significant for long agent sessions.

### 2. OpenCode — Open-Source Claude Code Alternative
**Relevance: 8/10** `#ai` `#tooling` `#agent`
**Links:** [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/opencode/alternatives) · [Review](https://solvedbycode.ai/blog/opencode-benchmark-review-january-2026) · [Deep Dive](https://blog.devgenius.io/the-definitive-guide-to-opencode-from-first-install-to-production-workflows-aae1e95855fb)

Terminal-first, open-source agentic coding CLI. ~60k GitHub stars (18k added in January alone after OpenAI + GitHub officially partnered with the project). Supports any model via LiteLLM — Claude, GPT-5, Gemini, Qwen — with no provider lock-in. Neovim-first philosophy, can delegate work across multiple agents, works directly on GitHub repos with full context awareness.

**So what:** If you ever hit Anthropic rate limits or subscription auth issues, OpenCode is a drop-in terminal companion that doesn't care which provider you use. The multi-model flexibility + 60k-star community means it's production-ready, not vaporware. Worth having it installed and configured even if you don't switch your primary workflow.

### 3. Entire CLI — Git Observability for AI Coding Sessions
**Relevance: 8/10** `#ai` `#agent` `#observability` `#openclaw`
**Links:** [Tech Edu Byte](https://www.techedubyte.com/entire-cli-git-observability-tool-ai-code-sessions/)

Built by Nat Friedman (ex-GitHub CEO). Entire CLI sits between your AI coding assistant and your Git repo, capturing AI-generated code changes, commit patterns, branch activity, merge conflicts, and performance metrics for AI suggestions — all stored in Git itself as a structured observability layer.

**So what:** When you're running OpenClaw agents that write code, you currently have no audit trail for what the agent did vs what you wrote. This fills that gap. Particularly useful for debugging agent regressions and understanding which AI-generated changes introduced bugs. The Git-native storage means no new infra.

### 4. AionUI — Local Multi-Agent Collaboration Hub for AI CLIs
**Relevance: 7/10** `#ai` `#agent` `#openclaw` `#tooling`
**Links:** [AIToolly](https://aitoolly.com/ai-news/article/2026-02-14-aionui-free-local-open-source-247-collaboration-and-openclaw-for-gemini-cli-claude-code-and-more)

Free, local, open-source UI platform that provides a unified collaboration layer across AI coding CLIs: OpenClaw, Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Qwen Code, Goose CLI, Auggie. Trending on GitHub. Designed for 24/7 multi-agent workflows where you want multiple AI agents coordinating on tasks without switching contexts.

**So what:** If you're orchestrating multiple agents across projects (Mission Control + mobile + infra), AionUI gives you a local control plane to watch them all. No SaaS, no lock-in — self-hosted by default. Could be worth evaluating as a dashboard layer on top of your existing OpenClaw setup.

### 5. myclaude — Multi-Agent Orchestration Across AI CLIs
**Relevance: 7/10** `#ai` `#agent` `#automation`
**Links:** [BrightCoding](https://www.blog.brightcoding.dev/2026/02/07/myclaude-the-multi-agent-orchestration-system-every-developer-needs)

Open-source orchestration system that unifies Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and OpenCode into coordinated multi-agent workflows. Lets agents hand off tasks between providers, with shared context and a single workflow graph.

**So what:** The multi-provider angle is the key differentiator vs running one agent at a time. If you want OpenClaw to farm subtasks out to specialized agents (e.g., Codex for boilerplate, Claude for architecture decisions), myclaude provides the routing layer without you building it yourself.

## 🔐 Security

### 6. SecureClaw — OWASP-Aligned Security Plugin for OpenClaw
**Relevance: 9/10** `#security` `#openclaw` `#agent`
**Links:** [Help Net Security](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2026/02/18/secureclaw-open-source-security-plugin-skill-openclaw/) · [Adversa AI Blog](https://adversa.ai/blog/adversa-ai-launches-secureclaw-open-source-security-solution-for-openclaw-agents/) · [PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/secureclaw-by-adversa-ai-launches-as-the-first-owasp-aligned-open-source-security-plugin-and-skill-for-openclaw-ai-agents-302688674.html)

Open-source security tool from Adversa AI built specifically for OpenClaw. Two-layer architecture: a **code-level plugin** that enforces hardening at the gateway/config level (can't be overridden by prompt injection), plus a **behavioral skill** that gives the agent real-time security awareness. Ships with 55 audit checks covering the full OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI — tool misuse, privilege abuse, goal hijacking, DLP, supply chain risk, and more.

**So what:** This is directly for your setup. You're running an AI agent with access to your files, messages, and calendar — the exact threat surface OWASP Agentic AI Top 10 addresses. The two-layer design is clever: skill-only security can be bypassed via prompt injection; the plugin layer can't. Run the 55-check audit against your current OpenClaw install. This is a genuine gap worth closing.

### 7. ⚠️ OpenAI + Persona + US Government Identity Surveillance
**Relevance: 6/10** `#security` `#privacy`
**Links:** [vmfunc Research](https://vmfunc.re/blog/persona/) · [Lobste.rs #1 story (76pts)](https://lobste.rs/s/yyqxg6/how_openai_us_government_persona_built) · [Piunikaweb](https://piunikaweb.com/2026/02/19/persona-age-verification-surveillance-allegations/)

Researchers at vmfunc published evidence that OpenAI, the US government, and identity verification startup Persona have been operating an identity surveillance system since November 2023. The government dashboard codebase — all 53MB across 2,456 files — was sitting unprotected on a FedRAMP-authorized government endpoint. Infrastructure analysis found dedicated GCP instances, Kubernetes namespaces, and wildcard certs tied to ICE's $4.2M AI surveillance contract (Fivecast ONYX).

**So what:** Background reading — but it has practical implications for anyone using Persona for identity verification (Discord used them until recently; Roblox still does). If you use any third-party KYC/identity tools in Mission Control, this is a reminder to audit what those vendors are doing with your users' biometric data downstream.

## ⚙️ Automation & Infrastructure

### 8. MinIO Deprecated → Garage / RustFS
**Relevance: 8/10** `#infra` `#self-hosted` `#storage`
**Links:** [Reading.sh writeup](https://news.reading.sh/2026/02/14/how-minio-went-from-open-source-darling-to-cautionary-tale/) · [DEV.to migration guide](https://dev.to/alexneamtu/how-we-replaced-minio-with-garage-for-self-hosted-s3-storage-23f7) · [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47000041)

On Feb 12, MinIO marked its GitHub repository "THIS REPOSITORY IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED" and redirected users to AIStor (commercial product). The community has been migrating fast. Top recommendations:
- **[Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/)** (Rust, AGPL-3.0) — ~50MB RAM vs MinIO's 500+MB, designed for self-hosted/edge, simple setup
- **[RustFS](https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs)** — fastest in benchmarks, more complex setup
- **[SeaweedFS](https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs)** — battle-tested, more complex

**So what:** If you have MinIO in any Docker stack (backups, file storage, dev S3-compat layer), it's now effectively abandonware. Garage is the easiest drop-in migration path with significantly lower resource footprint — relevant for your self-hosted VPS setup.

### 9. BrowserPod for Node.js — Secure Client-Side Code Sandboxes
**Relevance: 6/10** `#infra` `#security` `#nextjs`
**Links:** [AI Journal](https://aijourn.com/leaning-technologies-launches-secure-browser-based-code-sandboxes-for-ai/) · [Business Lancashire](https://www.businesslancashire.co.uk/2026/02/18/leaning-technologies-introduces-browser-native-execution-layer-for-secure-ai-workloads)

Leaning Technologies launched BrowserPod for Node.js — a universal execution layer for running untrusted Node.js code securely inside the browser, client-side, with no server required. Designed for AI-generated code execution use cases: low latency (runs next to the user), strong data control, sandboxed API.

**So what:** If Mission Control ever needs to let users run AI-generated code safely (previews, scripts, automations), BrowserPod handles the scary part — no server-side execution risk. Relevant for any "run this AI code" feature without spinning up isolated containers per user.
