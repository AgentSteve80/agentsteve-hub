## 🚨 CRITICAL — Read First

### 1. ⚠️ ClawHavoc — Supply Chain Attack on OpenClaw's ClawHub Registry
**Relevance: 10/10** `#security` `#openclaw` `#supply-chain`
**Links:** [CyberSecurityNews](https://cybersecuritynews.com/clawhavoc-poisoned-openclaws-clawhub/) · [Aryaka](https://www.aryaka.com/blog/securing-openclaw-agents-clawhavoc-supply-chain-attack-ai-secure-protection/) · [Conscia](https://conscia.com/blog/the-openclaw-security-crisis/) · [Security Boulevard](https://securityboulevard.com/2026/02/securing-openclaw-againstclawhavoc/) · [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/what-security-teams-need-to-know-about-openclaw-ai-super-agent/)

**What happened:** In late January 2026, multiple threat actors registered as ClawHub marketplace developers and mass-uploaded 1,184 trojanized Skills disguised as crypto trading bots, productivity tools, and social media utilities. Koi Security disclosed the campaign on **February 1, 2026** and named it **ClawHavoc**. Antiy CERT later classified the malware as the `TrojanOpenClaw PolySkill` family. By Feb 5, 1,184 malicious packages were traced to 12 publisher accounts (one account alone uploaded 677 packages). As of Feb 16, the count had grown to **824+ confirmed malicious Skills** still active across 10,700+ total Skills.

**Three attack behaviors:**
- **ClickFix-style downloaders** — prompt users to install a "component update," redirecting to password-protected malware archives containing Atomic macOS Stealer on macOS
- **Reverse-shell droppers** — establish persistent remote access to attacker-controlled servers
- **Direct data-stealing scripts** — immediately collect and exfiltrate credentials, tokens, and financial data

**Attack vector:** ClawHub's permissive upload model allowed any GitHub account older than 1 week to publish Skills. Despite removals after Feb 1 disclosure, dozens stayed live with thousands of downloads.

**So what:** You run OpenClaw. If you've installed any ClawHub Skills in the past 30 days — particularly anything productivity, social media, or trading-adjacent — audit them immediately. Cross-reference against Antiy's IOCs. Going forward: only install Skills from accounts you can verify (check GitHub account age, commit history, README quality). The SecureClaw audit from the morning report is now even more urgent to run — it specifically checks for compromised skill installations. Do not install new Skills until the ClawHub registry cleanup is confirmed complete.

### 2. Anthropic OAuth Ban — Botched Docs, But Real Policy Question
**Relevance: 8/10** `#ai` `#openclaw` `#anthropic`
**Links:** [HN #21 (474 pts)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47069299) · [r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1r8ecyq/anthropic_bans_oauth_tokens_from_consumer_plans/) · [Clarification post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1r88qh6/major_claude_code_policy_clear_up_from_anthropic/)

HN's #21 story today with 474 points and 566 comments: `code.claude.com` docs were updated to say Pro/Max subscription OAuth tokens cannot be used in third-party tools (OpenClaw, Zed, etc.) — only the pay-per-use API is allowed for that. Community panic ensued. An Anthropic employee clarified: **this was a botched docs update, not a real policy change**. You are not getting banned for using your subscription with third-party tools.

**So what:** You're using `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (pay-per-use), not OAuth, so you're unaffected by both the docs mistake and any future real enforcement. If you know anyone using Claude Pro via OAuth in OpenClaw, tell them they're currently safe but the policy intent is heading toward API-key-only for third-party use. Good time to double-check your OpenClaw config uses the API key, not an OAuth token.

### 3. APIAgent (Agoda) — Any REST/GraphQL API → MCP Server, Zero Code
**Relevance: 8/10** `#ai` `#openclaw` `#mcp` `#automation`
**Links:** [MarkTechPost](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/02/16/agoda-open-sources-apiagent-to-convert-any-rest-pr-graphql-api-into-an-mcp-server-with-zero-code/)

Open-sourced by Agoda's engineering team. Point APIAgent at any REST or GraphQL API spec (OpenAPI, introspection query), and it auto-generates a fully typed MCP server — no code, no deployment required. Handles auth, schema translation, and tool registration. Designed specifically for giving AI agents structured, type-safe access to existing APIs instead of fragile web scraping.

**So what:** Your Convex deployment at `curious-wolverine-246.convex.site` has an HTTP API. You could use APIAgent to expose it as an MCP server, giving OpenClaw and any other MCP-compatible agent direct typed tool access to Mission Control's data — without writing a custom MCP adapter. This is worth prototyping this week. Could also expose GitHub's API, your Docker monitoring stack, etc.

### 4. WebMCP — Chrome Turns Websites Into MCP Tool Calls for AI Agents
**Relevance: 6/10** `#ai` `#mcp` `#browser` `#automation`
**Links:** [OpenAI Tools Hub](https://www.openaitoolshub.org/en/blog/webmcp-chrome-ai-agents)

Available in Chrome 146 Canary behind a feature flag. WebMCP exposes a browser-side MCP server that lets AI agents interact with websites through structured tool calls instead of DOM scraping or screenshot analysis. Websites register their "capabilities" (like a form submit, a search, a data export) as MCP tools the agent can call directly.

**So what:** Medium-term relevance — when this ships stable, any AI agent you build (OpenClaw or Mission Control automations) could interact with web services you don't have API access to, without brittle scraping. File this for Q3 when it reaches stable Chrome.

### 5. Google Antigravity — Agent-First VS Code Fork Gaining Serious Traction
**Relevance: 7/10** `#ai` `#tooling` `#ide`
**Links:** [XDA Developers](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-antigravity-is-the-best-fork-of-microsoft-vs-code/) · [LogRocket Rankings](https://blog.logrocket.com/ai-dev-tool-power-rankings/) · [ShipAI Guide](https://www.shipai.dev/blog/google-antigravity-agentic-ide-guide)

VS Code fork from Google that treats the AI agent as the primary developer rather than an assistant. Gemini 3 Pro powered. Two modes: **Planning mode** (agent designs the approach, you review) and **Fast mode** (autonomous execution). Separates the "manager" from the "editor" — the agent has a full view of your repo and can delegate sub-tasks. LogRocket now ranks it #2 in AI dev tools (behind Windsurf), ahead of Cursor.

**So what:** Cursor is your current mental model for "AI IDE," but Antigravity's Planning mode (where the agent proposes before executing) is a legitimately different UX that might suit complex Mission Control or mobile app work. Worth a trial for a day of development to see if the agent-first model fits your workflow better.

### 6. ⚠️ Trae IDE — ByteDance VS Code Fork, Free Claude 3.7, Privacy Red Flags
**Relevance: 7/10** `#security` `#ai` `#tooling`
**Links:** [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/trae/reviews) · [DEV Community alert](https://dev.to/leuzga/alerta-para-desarrolladores-trae-ide-y-el-riesgo-real-con-el-codigo-de-tus-clientes-1cgg)

ByteDance (TikTok's parent) released Trae, a VS Code fork offering completely free access to Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o — no subscription. It's gaining users fast because of the "free Claude" hook. The DEV Community alert (trending today) warns: ByteDance's TOS gives them rights to use your code for model training, and as a Chinese company they're subject to data localization laws that could expose your source code to the Chinese government.

**So what:** Do not use Trae for Mission Control or any client code. The free Claude is a honeypot — you're paying with your IP. The Anthropic API cost for what you'd get from Trae "free" is probably $10-30/month anyway. File this under "risks to warn clients/contractors about."

### 7. Don't Trust the Salt — Multilingual LLM Guardrail Evaluation (Mozilla.ai)
**Relevance: 7/10** `#security` `#ai` `#agent`
**Links:** [Substack](https://royapakzad.substack.com/p/multilingual-llm-evaluation-to-guardrails) · [HN #1 today (88 pts)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47038032)

Mozilla.ai and Roya Pakzad published research testing LLM safety guardrails across languages. Key finding: guardrails tuned in English degrade significantly in other languages — the same prompt that's blocked in English often passes in Farsi, Arabic, or Mandarin. They tested 6 evaluation dimensions and found cross-lingual guardrail coverage is consistently 20-40% weaker than monolingual English coverage.

**So what:** If you're building any AI feature in Mission Control or your mobile app that takes user input and passes it to Claude/GPT, your prompt injection and content-policy guardrails are likely only tested in English. If your user base is multilingual (or even if you're using non-English prompts in OpenClaw workflows), your guardrails may have bigger holes than you think. Read the full evaluation methodology — it's directly applicable to implementing proper multilingual input validation.

### 8. Bruteforcing a Forgotten Bitwarden Master Password — Lobsters #10 (34 pts)
**Relevance: 6/10** `#security` `#cryptography`
**Links:** [compilercrim.es](https://compilercrim.es/forgor/) · [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/s/9dgwdo/bruteforcing_bitwarden_master_password)

Detailed writeup on recovering a Bitwarden master password using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with GPU acceleration. The author reverse-engineered Bitwarden's key derivation parameters, built a targeted wordlist from partial memory, and recovered it in <6 hours on a single GPU. The technical depth (KDF parameters, salt handling, hashcat mask attacks) is excellent.

**So what:** Practical reading for anyone using Bitwarden (which you likely do for self-hosted infra secrets). The key lesson: Bitwarden's default 600,000 PBKDF2 iterations are inadequate for GPU attacks if your password has any structure or partial predictability. Switch to Argon2id in Bitwarden settings. If you're self-hosting Vaultwarden, check your iteration count now.

## ⚙️ Automation & Infrastructure

### 9. Dockhand — Portainer Alternative With Built-in Vuln Scanning
**Relevance: 7/10** `#infra` `#docker` `#security` `#self-hosted`
**Links:** [Bitdoze comparison](https://www.bitdoze.com/portainer-alternatives/)

Open-source Docker management UI. Key differentiator over Portainer: built-in vulnerability scanning via Grype/Trivy on every image pull, "safe-pull" protection (blocks pulling images with known critical CVEs), OIDC authentication, and BSL license that's fine for self-hosting. Actively maintained. Beats Portainer in the security-focused Portainer alternatives roundup from bitdoze.com this week.

**So what:** If you're running Docker stacks on your VPS and using Portainer (or nothing), Dockhand adds the security scanning layer you'd otherwise need to wire up manually with a Trivy cron job. The safe-pull protection alone — blocking pulls with known critical CVEs before they reach your host — is a meaningful operational security improvement. Self-hostable, no cloud dependency.

### 10. Ito — Open-Source Voice Assistant (Self-Hosted, Intent-Aware)
**Relevance: 5/10** `#automation` `#ai` `#self-hosted`
**Links:** [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/ai-dictation-apps)

Product Hunt's #1 in AI dictation today. Open source, self-hostable voice assistant that captures "intent, not just words" — you speak loosely and it writes what you should send (message, task, note). Inspectable, forkable, no cloud lock-in.

**So what:** Low-priority for now, but worth bookmarking for the mobile app — if you ever want a voice-input mode for Mission Control's mobile view, Ito's intent-capture model is more useful than raw dictation. The open-source nature means you can tune the intent layer to your domain (dev tasks, project names, etc.).
