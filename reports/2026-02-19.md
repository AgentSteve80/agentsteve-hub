## 🤖 AI Tooling

### 1. Bloom — Open-Source Behavioral Eval Framework for LLMs
**https://github.com/safety-research/bloom/**  
*Anthropic · Released this week*

Anthropic open-sourced **Bloom**, a framework for automatically generating behavioral evaluations of frontier AI models. Give it a behavior to test (e.g., "sycophancy", "self-preservation", "instructed sabotage") and it auto-generates 100+ test scenarios, runs them, and scores the results. They benchmarked 16 frontier models and published the results.

**Why it's practical:** If you're building production LLM systems, this is how you measure alignment drift as you update models. No eval engineering required — specify the behavior, Bloom generates the suite. Integrates with W&B for scale. Released same day as Claude Sonnet 4.6.

### 2. GitHub Agentic Workflows — AI Agents in CI/CD (Technical Preview)
**https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-13-github-agentic-workflows-are-now-in-technical-preview/**  
*GitHub/Microsoft · Technical preview Feb 13 · Active development*

Write GitHub Actions workflows in **plain Markdown** instead of YAML. AI agents (Copilot or any MCP-compatible agent) handle the decision logic. Out-of-the-box use cases: issue triage, PR reviews, documentation updates, test coverage monitoring, CI failure investigation, daily repo health reports.

**Why it's practical:** This replaces the most tedious parts of repo maintenance with AI automation. You define *what* you want done; the agent figures out *how*. Works with custom MCPs, so you can wire in any external tool.

### 3. Claude Sonnet 4.6
**https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-6**  
*Anthropic · HN #4, 1,044pts, 917 comments*

Top story on HN today. You're running it. Worth knowing what changed.

## 🔐 Security

### 4. Augustus — LLM Vulnerability Scanner (210+ Attack Vectors)
**https://cybersecuritynews.com/augustus-llm-vulnerability-scanner/**  
*Praetorian · Released Feb 10, 2026*

Open-source scanner from Praetorian specifically for testing LLM deployments. Covers 210+ attack types across 28 LLM providers — prompt injection, jailbreaks, data exfiltration, context manipulation, role confusion. Automated red-teaming for AI endpoints.

**Why it's practical:** Run it against any LLM endpoint before shipping. Catches the attack classes that standard SAST/DAST tools miss entirely. Essential if you're exposing any model-backed API.

### 5. How a Single Typo Led to RCE in Firefox
**https://kqx.io/post/firefox0day/**  
*Lobsters · security + browsers tags · 40pts*

Detailed writeup of a browser RCE caused by a one-character off-by-one. Covers the full exploit chain: how the typo created a memory corruption primitive, how that was leveraged into arbitrary code execution, and how it was responsibly disclosed. 

**Why it's practical:** Essential reading for anyone doing browser-facing code or security research. The exploit chain methodology is reusable knowledge.

### 6. Google Public CA Outage — Know Your Certificate Dependencies
**https://status.pki.goog/incidents/5oJEbcU3ZfMfySTSXXd3**  
*HN #30 · 237pts · 134 comments · Active incident today*

Google's public Certificate Authority went down today. If your infrastructure validates cert chains through Google PKI (common in GCP deployments), this caused real failures. The HN thread has solid discussion on monitoring CA dependencies.

**Why it's practical:** Audit your CA dependency chain. If a single CA going down breaks your infra, that's a gap. Consider certificate pinning or secondary validation paths for critical services.

## ⚙️ Dev Tools & Automation

### 7. BarraCUDA — Open-Source CUDA Compiler for AMD GPUs
**https://github.com/Zaneham/BarraCUDA**  
*HN #8 · 259pts · 95 comments · Active: Tenstorrent branch in dev*

One dev. 15,000 lines of C99. A full CUDA→AMD GPU compiler with **zero LLVM dependency**. Takes `.cu` files, runs them through lexer → parser → SSA IR → register allocation → ELF emission, and outputs `.hsaco` binaries for AMD RDNA 3 (GFX1100). Every instruction encoding validated against `llvm-objdump`.

Supports: `__shared__` memory, `__syncthreads__`, atomics, warp intrinsics, half precision, cooperative groups, templates, full C preprocessor, error recovery.

Build process: `make`. Requirements: a C99 compiler.

**Why it's practical:** Run existing CUDA workloads on AMD GPUs without HIP, ROCm translation layers, or any LLVM dependency. Active development — Tenstorrent backend in progress.

### 8. `go fix` — Automated Go Code Modernization  
**https://go.dev/blog/gofix**  
*HN #15 · 326pts · 68 comments · Lobsters · Part of Go toolchain*

The Go team just properly documented `go fix`, the built-in tool for automatically upgrading deprecated patterns in Go codebases. Think codemods but native to the Go toolchain — no third-party deps, no configuration.

**Why it's practical:** If you maintain any Go codebase, add `go fix ./...` to your CI. It handles API migrations automatically as the Go standard library evolves. Saves the manual deprecation chase after every Go release.

### 9. Shaper — Self-Hosted BI on DuckDB *(Watch List)*
**https://github.com/taleshape-com/shaper**  
*HN · 14pts · Just launched today*

A new open-source BI/analytics tool built on DuckDB — positioned as a self-hosted alternative to Metabase for teams already using DuckDB or wanting OLAP-style queries without a heavyweight stack.

**Why it's worth watching:** DuckDB has become the SQLite of analytical workloads. A mature BI layer on top of it would be genuinely useful. Too new to evaluate maintenance trajectory, but the timing is right.

---

### 10. Babashka 1.12.215 — Clojure Scripting Runtime with TUI Support
**https://blog.michielborkent.nl/babashka-1.12.215.html**  
*Lobsters · 37pts · Actively maintained (regular releases)*

Babashka is a fast-startup Clojure scripting runtime — think "Clojure as a bash replacement." This release adds `babashka.tui`, a TUI library for building terminal interfaces directly in Clojure scripts. Also improvements to the nREPL server and pod system.

**Why it's practical:** If you write shell scripts and hate shell, Babashka is the alternative. Starts in milliseconds. Full Clojure syntax. Now you can build interactive terminal tools with it too.

## 🌐 Ecosystem Signals

**Gentoo moves to Codeberg** — https://www.gentoo.org/news/2026/02/16/codeberg.html  
HN #12 · 314pts. Gentoo migrating off GitHub to the non-profit Codeberg. Part of a growing pattern (Vinyl Cache also left GitHub today per Lobsters). Worth watching if you host on GitHub and care about long-term infrastructure independence.

**r/programming bans generic AI content** — https://www.reddit.com/r/programming  
Rules update just dropped: "Generic AI content that has nothing to do with programming — it's gotten out of hand and our users hate it." Also banned: AI-generated posts, newsletters, "I made this" without technical writeup. Quality bar going up.

**AI had no measurable productivity impact** — https://fortune.com/2026/02/17/ai-productivity-paradox-ceo-study-robert-solow-information-technology-age/  
HN · 374pts · 257 comments. CEO survey data: AI investment hasn't moved the productivity needle yet. Worth reading for calibration — the tools are getting better but the productivity wave is still mostly forecast, not measured.
